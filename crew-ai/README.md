# Practical Multi AI Agents and Advanced Use Cases with crewAI

This repository contains the projects I built while taking the "Practical Multi AI Agents and Advanced Use Cases with crewAI" course.

The focus of the course was on understanding multi-agent systems, advanced workflows, tool integration, and scaling AI solutions using CrewAI.

## ðŸ“Œ Projects Covered

As part of the course, I implemented five hands-on projects:

1. Automated Project Planning, Estimation, and Allocation
- Learnt how to build an agent and a crew for project planning.

2. Project Progress Report
- Learnt how to integrate internal and external tools with CrewAI.

3. Agentic Sales Pipeline
- Built complete agentic flows in CrewAI to automate a sales pipeline.

4. Data Insight Analysis
- Practiced testing, fine-tuning agents, and performance optimization.

5. Content Creation at Scale
- Explored how to integrate multiple LLMs for scalable content generation.

## ðŸš€ Key Learnings

- Designing individual agents and coordinating them within crews.
- Building workflows with tool integration (APIs, databases, etc.).
- Optimizing multi-agent systems for scalability and efficiency.
- Applying CrewAI to real-world advanced use cases.
